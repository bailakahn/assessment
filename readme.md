# KLF Technical Assessment

## Assessment 01

For this assessment i didn't used any class or function i just cleaned the code

## Assessment 02

I created two functions for this assessment. 

__cleanData()__ to clean all the data sent by the user and __sendMail()__ to send the mail in a proper way  

## Assessment 03

To do the assessment 03:

1 - I created a Database class that allow us
to connect to a Database and define basic MySQL queries and prepared queries.

2 - I crated a Model class with base CRUD functions. Then i created a UserModel
class that extends the Model class. This user model can define customized 
function and operations for the user table.

3 - I created a test file to test my CRUD functions.

I assumed that i don't need to verify if the $_GET or $_POST variables are set or valid
for the purpose of this model

## Assessment 04

I created a User class and a Order class that uses the configuration files to do the job.
