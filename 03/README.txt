To do the assessment 03:

1 - I created a Database class that allow us
to connect to a Database and define basic MySQL queries and prepared queries.

2 - I crated a Model class with base CRUD functions. Then i created a UserModel
class that extends the Model class. This user model can define customized 
function and operations for the user table.

3 - I created a test file to test my CRUD functions.

I assumed that i don't need to verify if the $_GET or $_POST variables are set or valid
for the purpose of this model
